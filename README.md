# Getting Started
Mac OSX
- Install homebrew (http://brew.sh/)
```
brew install nvm
nvm install v4.1.0
npm install
node index.js
```
Need to configure program to read external data and persist it in a local
datastore (if this is the only way we can create an index).

# Steps
- Capture and persist data.
- Possibly use `wit.ai` for human query to data.

Need to be able to have a db solution that can query geo and know which poly the
address falls inside.
